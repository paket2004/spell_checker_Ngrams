        "1. I decided to use bigrams, because while looking through different N-grams I see that it is most frequent situation that such N gram from the test texts is not presented in the N gram probability tables. Of course, this is also the case for the bigrams, but it is less frequent. I assign the 1e-8 value for such cases. It allows to equally treat the cases for the unknown bigrams and operate with the QWERTY distance between the buttons on the keyboard (typos check)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. I decided to divide the value obtained by a euclidian distance between the buttons so that do not allow cases where one word chosen instead another just due to the reason that it is \"common\" typo. For example, if we type \"gyu\" it is pretty obvious for humans that we want to say \"guy\", not \"buy\". But, without any penalties for euclidian distance my program thinks that that \"buy\" is better than \"guy\" in such cases (and context doesn't help)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Now let me say about bigrams itself. They are collected by group of smart people, however they are not really good and, maybe, requires a deep preprocessing to use. There are a lot of strange words in this bigrams with length 1-3 and they just make noise while predicting the candidate. They obtain scores, they are not so far from the word that we need to correct, and, therefore, while using k = 30 as number of candidates to generate out of these 30 candidates only about 5 are words that are really used in the lexicon. I tried different approaches, for example, nltk words, but, unfortunately, they face exactly the same issue, and, additionally, doesn't have the plural form of words, while these bigrams have. Additionally, I used 5grams, test it and decided to use only bigrams, because it is almost impossible to catch the context of 5 words so that it would be presented in the probability table. Or, another issue, for fivegrams probabilities would be usually 1 or 0, very rarely something between, what is also bad, because in such cases we pay to much attention to the 5gram presented in the dataset, but not necessary we want use it.\n",
